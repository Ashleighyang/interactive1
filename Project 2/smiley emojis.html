		<h3 style="text-align:center">Introduction</h3>
		<p>According to the Oxford English Dictionary, an emoji is a “small digital image or icon used to express an idea or emotion in electronic communication”.
			The emoticon, the predecessor of emoji,
			is created by Professor Scott Fallman of Carnegie Mellon University in the United States on September 19,
			1982 and was born in the form of an electronic bulletin board. Originally it was a string of ASCII characters,
			looks like this</p>

		<p>It was approved as part of Unicode 1.1 in 1993 under the name “White Smiling Face”

			The development of emoji was predated by text-based emoticons,as well as graphical representations, inside and outside of Japan.

			The first emoji was created in 1999 in Japan by Shigetaka Kurita.He was part of the team working on NTT DoCoMo's i-mode mobile Internet platform.Kurita took inspiration from weather forecasts that used symbols to show weather, Chinese characters and street signs, and from manga that used stock symbols to express emotions, such as lightbulbs signifying inspiration.

			At that time need to limit the number of emoji, the development team finally decided that roughly 200. Shigetaka Kurita first listed the type of emoji, then continue to add or delete changes. </br>Here’s a draft below.
